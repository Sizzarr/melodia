# Melodia - One-Pager Pitch

## 🎵 The Problem

**Artists are getting exploited in the traditional music industry.**

- **Lack of Transparency**: Artists often don't know how their royalties are calculated or distributed
- **Long Payment Cycles**: Royalty payments can take 6-18 months to reach artists
- **Limited Access to Capital**: Independent artists struggle to fund their work
- **Gatekeeping**: Major labels control access to funding and distribution

> The global music industry generates **$26 billion annually** in recorded music revenue, yet most artists receive only **12-20%** of streaming royalties.
